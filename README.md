Dice thrower
======

This is my prototype of a dice thrower tool used for role-playing games.
Also my practice of the MVC pattern using Java Swing.
This tool only supports for now the dice rules of one game.

You throw a number of d6 and count how many 5s and 6s are displayed.

To build this you need Java Devolpment Kit 7.
